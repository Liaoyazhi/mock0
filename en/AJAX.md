# AJAX

Asynchronous JavaScript And XML (**AJAX**) is a programming practice of building more complex,
dynamic webpages using a technology known as XMLHttpRequest.

What AJAX allows you to do is just update parts of the DOM of a HTML webpage instead of having to
reload the entire page. AJAX also lets you work asynchronously, meaning your code continues to run
while that part of your webpage is trying to reload (compared to synchronously which will block your
code from running until that part of your webpage is done reloading).

With interactive websites and modern web standards, AJAX is gradually being replaced by functions
within JavaScript frameworks and the official Fetch API Standard.
